# jamz-components

A simple and reusable component library built with React, designed for learning and experimenting with component design.

## About

This project is a personal initiative to practice creating a component library while learning to use tools like **Storybook** for component documentation and testing. Itâ€™s not intended for production but rather as a stepping stone to improve my frontend development skills.

## Features

- Reusable and modular components
- Storybook integration for isolated component testing and documentation
- Built with **React** and **Typescript** for modern development standars.

## Tech Stack

- **React**: Component-based UI library.
- **Storybook**: Development and documentation environment.
- **TypeScript**: Strongly typed JavaScript for maintainable code.
- **Vite** (or your preferred build tool): For fast development and bundling.

## ðŸŽ¯ Goals

1. Learn and experiment with Storybook.
2. Practice modular and scalable component design.
3. Explore the process of documenting and testing components.
